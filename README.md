#dnode Host

dnode Host is a simple wrapper around dnode/upnode functionality, simplifying creation and operation of dnode clients and hosts.

Clients will automatically buffer commands and reconnect if the host
goes down.

Clients and Hosts can be shut down permanently with `shutdown()`
command.

All you need to do is supply your host and client API's and you're set.
